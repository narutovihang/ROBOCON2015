# ROBOCON 2015 Robominton
Codes of ROBOCON 2015

It is a old repository of all the codes used by Team Kjsiet in Robocon 2015. We were a team of 26 people and I was given the honor of leading them.

> What is Robocon?
Simply put, it is the toughest Robotics contest in Asia at undergraduate level. In India nearly 100 teams participate every year.

Robocon 2015: 
The [Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0XEc4N8yvE) for Robocon 2015 was Robominton and the contesting teams were asked to build Robot's that play double's Badminton. 

[Team KJSIET](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsieit/Initiative/Robocon) was participating for the 3rd consecutive year. We do not have a mechanical department and we use this oppurtunity to understand mechanical design too along with Electronics and Programming.

**Performance of Team KJSIET Robocon: Rank: Joint 10th.This was our Best ever performance.Last two ranks:46th and 48th.**
